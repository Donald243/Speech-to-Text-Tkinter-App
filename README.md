# Speech-to-Text-Tkinter-App


Description:
A simple Python application that converts speech to text using the speech_recognition library and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. This project allows users to click a button, speak into their microphone, and see the transcribed text displayed in real-time. It includes error handling for speech recognition and API connectivity issues.

Features:
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken input to text using Googleâ€™s Web Speech API.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter, the app includes a clean and intuitive GUI.
Real-Time Feedback: Users are notified when the app is actively listening.
Error Handling: Provides alerts for cases where audio cannot be recognized or if there are connectivity issues.
Cross-Platform: Works on any platform that supports Python and has a microphone.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies (speechrecognition, tkinter).
Run the application.
Click the "Start Speech-to-Text" button and speak into your microphone.
View the transcribed text in the output area.
This project is ideal for beginners learning about speech recognition, Python GUIs, or creating interactive desktop applications.
